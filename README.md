# Waynova Technologies - Research & Innovation Platform

Welcome to the official repository for the Waynova Technologies website—a modern, responsive platform showcasing research in algorithmic trading, machine learning, and AI innovation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Waynova Technologies** is a research-driven initiative focused on bridging the gap between advanced AI and financial markets. This website serves as the central hub for our community, research publications, and educational resources.

The design utilizes a premium **Glassmorphism** aesthetic with dynamic canvas-based animations to reflect our focus on futuristic technology and data science.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Immersive Hero Section**: Features a custom 3D particle system ("Neural Network" style) and a background stock chart animation.
*   **Modern UI/UX**: Built with a "Glassmorphism" design system, using translucent cards, gradients, and smooth glowing effects.
*   **Bento Grid Layouts**: Responsively designed grids for showcasing 'Features' and 'Research Areas'.
*   **Interactive Components**:
    *   Dynamic Navigation Bar with scroll-aware transparency.
    *   Mobile-responsive hamburger menu.
    *   Smooth scrolling with parallax effects.
    *   FAQ section with accordion-style Q&A.
*   **Performance Focused**: Lightweight, dependency-free implementation for maximum speed.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

This project is built using pure, vanilla web technologies to ensure longevity and understanding:

*   **HTML5**: Semantic markup for accessibility and SEO.
*   **CSS3**: Custom styling with Flexbox, Grid, CSS Variables, and Animations.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: No frameworks. Handles all logic including:
    *   `Canvas` API for background animations.
    *   `IntersectionObserver` for scroll reveal animations.
    *   DOM manipulation for UI interactions.

## ⚡ Getting Started

This is a static website and requires no build process.

1.  **Clone or Download** the repository.
2.  **Open** the project folder.
3.  **Launch**: Double-click `index.html` to open it in your default web browser.

> **Tip:** For the best development experience, use a local server (like standard VS Code Live Server) to avoid any CORS issues with local assets, though this project is designed to work directly from the file system.

## 🎨 Customization

*   **Content**: Edit `index.html` to update text, links, and sections.
*   **Styles**: Modify `:root` variables in `styles.css` (lines 1-50) to change the color scheme (Blue/Gold theme) or typography.
*   **Animations**: Tweak `script.js` classes (`ParticleSystem`, `StockChartAnimation`) to adjust speed, colors, or particle density.
